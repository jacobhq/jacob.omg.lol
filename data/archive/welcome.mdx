---

I've tried out many newsletter tools, but as some of you may know, none of them have really stuck. Some developers I know have adopted buttondown, and as it has a 
decent api, it might be the one for me. So here I am, yet again, starting my umpteenth newsletter. You've probably came from yet another tweet I've wrote, about
how I'm starting a newsletter. Let's hope this one's the one!

Anyway, welcome to my newsletter. In general, I'm probably going to be talking about what I've been doing in the JS world, from any PRs I'm working on to any
articles I've read to the latest library or framework I've stumbled on. So you should probably get comfortable, grab something with a nice screen, and read on.

I recently tried out [Linear](https://linear.app) because [@pacocoursey](https://twitter.com/pacocoursey) started working there. This lead me to start working in 
sprints, going from project to project, but shipping new features *fast*. What I usually do is have some time where I create issues in Linear, and then start 
work by copying the branch name, and creating a PR. I've been shipping at an unsustainable rate, but I'm aiming to ship about one a week. I've found this new 
workflow allows me to focus on tasks and projects, and has prevented me from shipping half baked features. If I don't get to finish shipping a feature, then I 
label the PR as `stale`, and move on. You may have seen this workflow applied in my repos, namely `jacobhq/jacob.omg.lol`.

To be honest, I haven't really read any interesting articles recently, so I won't be able to deliver on that. What I can talk to you about however, is the new 
features I've shipped to my personal website. I'm currently migrating all my content to [contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev), something which I know quite 
little about. In my experience so far, it seems like a nice way to get type annotations for your front matter your markdown files. You can have multiple document
types, which you can define in a `contentlayer.config.ts`, and you define properties about fields in your front matter. After you've done this, start writing 
your content, and experience the types. As I write this, I've just finished the migration from my old blog based on the learn nextjs starter kit. The experience 
was really easy, and allowed me to remove many dependencies from my code.

Now let's move on to speak about a few of the PRs that I've been working on. If you've ever seen my personal website, you'll know that I *love* Chakra UI. After 
using it for many projects, I decided that I needed to give something back. I found that I already knew a lot of the maintainers on twitter, and after submitting 
my first few PRs, I decided to take on something bigger. I took on an issue, and I think I bit off more than I could chew. So, after letting the PR sit for a while, 
I decided to plan my next sprint around it.

Another thing that I've been up to is my [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/channel/UChXCa0OuD-HYr3QAESK434g). I've been doing live streams and short videos for 
while now, something which I hope I'll be able to keep up. I do have to be careful to make sustainable commitments that I can continue to do, even in busy periods 
of my life. Next time, I'll probably write about how I organise my life.

Well, I'm going to wrap up here, because this actually took much longer than I planned to write. If you liked the post, please tweet about it (I'm 
[@jhqcat](https://twitter.com/jhqcat)), and if you really liked it, then please feel free to [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/jem).

Thank you so much for reading,
