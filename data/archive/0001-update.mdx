Hello reader,

It's been a while, and a lot has happened. First of all, I've decided to make this newsletter kind of a journal for getting into tech. I am 14, so this newsletter will probably end up being sent out **whenever I feel like it**, so I'm not going to follow any kind of schedule. I've been silent for a while, so let me walk you through what I've been up to.

#### 1. Shipping a startup
That's right. [Notelabs](https://notelabs.me/) is a new way to take notes. As a student, I use Google Docs a lot, and was disappointed that such a large company could fail so much at creating a nice document experience even on their own devices. I aim to solve this with Notelabs, where performance is key. I regularly test this on a lowspec chromebook with many tabs open, and the load time is **consistently under 2s**. If you think it sounds cool, follow on twitter ([@trynotelabs](https://twitter.com/trynotelabs)), and I'll try to keep you informed.

#### 2. Increasing password security
I, like many of you, am trying to have secure passwords. In fact I've been trying different strategies for **five years** now. I went from literally one password to the browser autofill to Dashlane, Lastpass, and iCloud keychain. I also had a phase of storing api credentials in text files on my desktop. I had tried 1Password before a few years ago, back when v7 had just been released, and enjoyed it, but I just couldn't justify *actually paying* monthly for a password manager. But, with the recent release of 1Password 8, I decided to give it another shot. I even changed all my passwords on my portfolio of over **150 online accounts**. I was commited. I decided that the beautiful design of v8, combined with the amazing CLI, was worth the fee. And that's why I am here flexing the fact that my Watchtower security score in [@1Password](https://twitter.com/1password) is 1117 (Fantastic).

Ok that's a wrap on this undefined time period's newsletter, hope you enjoyed it. Please do these things:

- Follow me on twitter ([@jhqcat](https://twitter.com/jhqcat))
- Follow me on github ([@jacobhq](https://github.com/jacobhq))
- Buy me a coffee ([/jem](https://buymeacoffee.com/jem))

Thanks,
