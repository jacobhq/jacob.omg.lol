Hello reader,

I've been busy in the coding world since I last emailed. I fixed a few bugs on my blog and made a few PRs in repos like [chakra-ui/chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) and [geist-org/geist-ui](https://github.com/geist-org/geist-ui), but I have mainly been focusing most of my efforts on [jacobhq/startrack](https://github.com/jacobhq/startrack). Startrack is like twitter intents, but for GitHub, allowing you to easily star apps with a simple URL. I recently launched Startrack, and it's currently on eight upvotes, which is good for the first two days. I'd really apreciate it if you checked it out, and maybe even upvoted it! Oh look, a handy badge for you to click on wonder how that got there...

In other news, it's WWDC today! We'll be seeing iOS 16, iPadOS 16, watchOS 9, and macOS 13, and there are even roumers of the launch of an M2 chip. I'm really looking forward to it. It seems like last week we saw the iOS 15 Safari, and I wrote [this tweet](https://twitter.com/jhqcat/status/1425026042822119447). Anyway, it's been a short one, because I've got exams this week, but you can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jhqcat) rambling about WWDC in about three hours. Remember to upvote using that handy badge, and I'll see you then!

Thanks for reading,

Jacob
