Web developer? Yep, I know. If you've ever written any CSS, which you probably have, then you may have seen the `cubic-bezier()` function. To know more about it, will first need to learn more about Bezier curves. What I've shown here (sorry dark mode users) is an example of a cubic bezier curve.

As you can see, it consists of four points, joined by blue lines, three more points, joined by purple dashed lines, and finally, two more, which are joined by green dashed lines. The red line is our Bezier curve.

Now let's link this back to CSS. The `cubic-bezier()` is a timing function, used in animations.
